A Roblox executor that has different flavors. Flavors can mean API's I guess. There is a whole lot of them!



## Features

- cool animations
- different flavors
- no installation
- of course, no virus.



## FAQ

####  Is this a virus?

No it is not, a few have false positives. If you do not trust one, use another flavor.

#### Does that mean this is skidded?

Yes, the API is skidded, although not the GUI.
